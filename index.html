Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Organize your material according to the "inverted pyramis".</h3>
              <p>Assume that your reader will quit reading before they reach the end of your story. Load the beginning of your article with the most essential facts so they still get the gist of it. Imagine a pyramid flipped upside down, with its widest part is on top. Aim to fill that space with all of the essentials, and then taper off with less relevant info as you reach the narrowest point at the bottom.
The inverted pyramid is especially important for online content, since its readers are less likely to read a story in full. Also, having the most relevant information at the beginning increases the story’s chances of popping in keyword searches.
This technique is also referred as “front-loading.”</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

          <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Write a strong lead.</h3>
              <p>Aim to hook your audience into reading further. At the same time, provide them with a condensed version of the story right up front in case they move on. Include the five W’s and one H in your first paragraph: who, what, when, where, why, and how. To present the essence of the story all at once, address them all in the very first sentence (known as the “summary” or “hard news” lead). To tantalize the reader into reading more, experiment by breaking them up over the first and second.
Summary lead: “More than 200 firefighters fought a six-alarm fire that destroyed 36 homes and six businesses on Myrtle Avenue in the Ridgewood section of Queens late Sunday night.”</p>

              <h3>Give more background after the lead.</h3>
              <p>Use your first paragraph to provide the most basic info. From there, flesh out the story in more detail. Continue presenting the facts in order of the most relevant. For example:
"What began as a grease fire in the kitchen of Tony’s Restaurant at 1411 Myrtle Ave quickly spread to neighboring buildings due to Sunday’s high winds."</p>

              <h3>Include a quote early on.</h3>
              <p>Give your reader someone to relate to. Introduce a witness or source within the first few paragraphs. Continue to pepper your story with the voices of people who played a part in and/or were directly affected by its events. For example:
              “'This is the worst fire this neighborhood has had in some time,' said Fire Commissioner Joseph Hernandez."</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Write short paragraphs.</h3>
              <p>Remember that your reader is likely to skim the article before deciding on whether or not they will read it. Make your text easy to skim by avoiding long paragraphs. Stick to a maximum of two sentences each, or even just a single sentence.
To further avoid large blocks of text, keep your sentences short as well. Use 30 words or less per sentence. Rewrite any dependent clauses so that each one becomes its own sentence.</p>

              <h3>Finish with interesting but inessential info.</h3>
              <p>Conclude your article with a quote or angle that fleshes the story out a little bit more. However, make sure that this info isn’t critical for the reader to know in order to understand the whole story. Expect the very end of your article to be cut to save space if need be.
Reread the whole article, minus your last couple of paragraphs, to verify that it still makes sense without the additional info.</p>
